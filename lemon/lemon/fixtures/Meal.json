        "desc": "Grilled fish is a delectable dish that combines fresh, high-quality fish with the smoky, savory flavors of an open flame or grill. The process typically begins with selecting a firm, fresh fish such as salmon, trout, or seabass. The fish is cleaned, scaled, and sometimes marinated with a mixture of herbs, spices, lemon juice, or other seasonings to enhance its natural flavors.\r\n\r\nGrilling fish requires careful attention to cooking time and temperature to avoid drying it out. Fish can be grilled whole, in fillets, or as steaks. When grilling whole fish, slits may be made in the flesh to allow seasonings to penetrate, and lemon or herbs can be inserted into the cavity for added flavor.\r\n\r\nThe grilling process imparts a smoky, charred taste and crispy exterior, while keeping the interior tender and juicy. Grilled fish pairs well with a variety of sides such as roasted vegetables, rice, or salads, making it a healthy and delicious meal option.",
